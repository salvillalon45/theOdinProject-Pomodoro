[TheOdinProject: Web Development 101] - Project: Pomodoro

# Summary
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system where you work for a period of time then take a short break, then work for a period of time then take a short break, and so on.

Here I created a Pomodoro clock similar to [this](http://romantic-trouble.surge.sh/) which will count down twenty-five minutes of work, indicate it is break time, count down five minutes, then start over again.
I added some extra things. Such as the following:
- Added support for customizing the long break
- Added chimes so that user knows when the break started, work has started, or long break has started
- Modify title tag so that the user can move to a different tab and know how much time they have left
-
